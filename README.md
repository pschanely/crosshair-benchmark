# CrossHair Benchmarks

Benchmarking data and scripts to evaluate the performance of
[CrossHair](https://github.com/pschanely/CrossHair).

## Background

CrossHair finds counter-examples on a best-effort basis.
Sometimes it'll find a counterexample immediately, sometimes in hours, and sometimes
effectively never.

This repo aims to provide a realistic set of examples to help CrossHair understand
whether any given change privdes more benefit than harm.

## Contributions

Contributions are **strongly** encouraged - the postive impact of this benchmark suite
is driven by having plentiful, diverse, and realistic examples.

By contributing examples, you will help guide CrossHair performance, to the
benefit of yourself and others.
